NOTICE TO THE BAR AND PUBLIC 
COLLECTION OF VOLUNTARY JUROR DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION --
INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION IN BERGEN, CAMDEN, AND MIDDLESEX COUNTIES 
The Supreme Court in State v. Dangcil, 248 N.J. 114, 146 (2021), 
directed the collection of voluntary juror demographic information as to race, 
ethnicity, and gender. The Court as part of its July 12, 2022 Administrative 
Determinations on the Report of the Committee of the Judicial Conference on 
Jury Selection, approved the Committee's recommendations as to how those 
demographic questions should be worded. The Court also approved updates to 
the juror qualification questionnaire in order to begin collecting that 
demographic information, starting for all trials in Bergen, Camden, and 
Middlesex Counties, as part of the pilot program on attorney-conducted voir 
dire. The collection of juror demographic information will expand statewide 
sometime in 2023. 
The attached enhanced juror qualification questionnaire, which includes 
those demographic questions, will be used in Bergen, Camden, and Middlesex. 
Those same questions have been added to the online juror qualification portal 
( eResponse ). 
The collection of voluntary juror demographic information will help the 
Judiciary understand the diversity and representativeness of jury pools. Juror 
responses to demographic questions are optional and will not affect juror 
selection. 
Questions on this notice should be directed to Statewide Manager of Jury 
Programs Brian J. McLaughlin at (609) 815-2900 x58133.
