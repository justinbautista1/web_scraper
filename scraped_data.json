I received a Juror Summons. What should I do?\n        \nIf you received a summons, the first step is to complete the qualification questionnaire. Jurors can complete the qualification questionnaire using the online portal or using the mailed letter version.\nJurors who do not have the ability to submit the online qualification questionnaire will automatically be mailed a printed version. The printed qualification questionnaire can be filled out in writing and mailed or emailed back to the county Jury Management office.\nAll jurors must complete the qualification questionnaire even if you are making a request to be excused or rescheduled.\nAfter completing the questionnaire, check the Jury Reporting page the night before your summons date for instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I log into the juror portal?\n        \n\nDo not set up a new account. An account is already set up for you.\nUse the 10-digit Participant ID and 5-digit zip code from your summons to log into the My Jury Service portal.\nYour User ID is your 10-digit Participant ID (include all zeros. e.g. 0001234567).\nYour Password is your 5-digit zip code.\nFor more information on logging into the MyJuryService Portal visit: Quick Reference Guide  My Jury Service (MJS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What should I do if I lost my Juror Questionnaire/Summons?\n        \nIf you misplace your Juror Summons or Juror Questionnaire, you should contact the Jury Management Office in your county for a replacement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I update my address?\n        \nJurors may update their address two ways:\n\nJurors who completed their Juror Questionnaire online can update their address through the juror portal under the personal contact information section.\nJurors mailing in the printed version of the Juror Questionnaire can update their address on this form under the Other Information section. Check the box for address change and write your new address on the line provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Is my employer required to pay me when I have jury service?\n        \nIn New Jersey there is no statutory requirement that a private employer pay your salary during juror service. Whether or not your employer pays you for jury duty depends on your employment situation, including employers' policies, union contracts, etc. The State of New Jersey will pay you the appropriate juror fee as set forth in the New Jersey statutes. The Jury Management Office is aware that many employers do not pay their employees during jury duty. If service as a juror will create a severe financial hardship, as set forth in N.J.S.A. 2B:20-10, you may request to be excused. But please be aware that nonpayment by your employer, by itself, is not a valid reason to be excused from service. Each situation will be reviewed individually.\nIf you are employed full time by the State of New Jersey, you will receive your usual compensation while you serve as a juror. However, in accordance with N.J.S.A. 2B:20-16 you will not receive juror payment. This law applies to persons employed full time by any agency, independent authority, instrumentality of the State of any political subdivision of the State (such as counties or municipalities). Jurors affected by this policy should notify the Jury Management Office when they report for service. If a check is issued to you in error, you will be required to return it to the Jury Management Office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Can I be penalized by my employer for serving on jury duty?\n        \nN.J.S.A. 2B:20.17 prohibits an employer from penalizing you because you serve as a juror. Penalties for a violation of this statute include the possibility of a criminal charge, as a disorderly persons offense, and a possible civil action for monetary damages and for reinstatement of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What are the penalties for failing to report for jury service?\n        \nFailure to respond to the summons will result in further court action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How will I know if the court is closed due to inclement weather?\n        \nDuring inclement weather situations, all jurors, should check the State Court Closing Informationpage prior to reporting to the courthouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What should I do if I am summoned but no longer live in the county that summoned me or in New Jersey?\n        \nIf you no longer live in New Jersey or received a Juror Summons from a county you no longer reside in, you must complete the Juror Questionnaire. You will be asked about your residency on question one.\nCompleting the Juror Questionnaire will allow the Jury Management Office to update your jury system record, which will prevent later enforcement efforts if there is no response to the summons (since N.J statutes require a response).\nThe Judiciary is required, for jury selection purposes, to merge lists of registered voters, licensed drivers, New Jersey personal income tax filers. Non-residents can be summoned when changes are delayed during list processing or if record holders have not updated their records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Can I collect unemployment while serving as a juror for New Jersey?\n        \nYou may still collect unemployment benefits while serving as a juror. N.J.S.A. 43:21-4(c)(5) protects a person's unemployment benefits during juror service. That statute states the following:\n\n(5) An unemployed individual, who is otherwise eligible, shall not be deemed unavailable for work or ineligible solely by reason of the individual's attendance before a court in response to a summons for service on a jury.\n\nIf an employment interview is scheduled on a day on which you need to report for juror service, notify the Jury Management Office, in advance if possible, and your service will be rescheduled to a later date. Please be aware that verification may be required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Why is it important that I serve as a juror?\n        \nJurors are an essential part of our justice system. The right to trial by jury in the United States dates from Colonial times and is rooted in English history. It is guaranteed by the Sixth and Seventh Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America and Article One of New Jerseys State Constitution. People have a right to have matters determined by a jury of their peers. Participating in our judicial system is not only an honor, but is also one of our civic duties. Although juror service may be inconvenient, citizens must participate in the jury process in order for it to work. Cases that go to trial need to be resolved by citizens who hear the evidence, determine the facts and render a verdict. It is impossible to get a fair cross-section of the community to participate in the jury system if people do not report for jury service. If you ever found yourself or a loved one involved in a civil or criminal trial, it's likely that you would want a jury of fellow citizens who will be fair and impartial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I reschedule my jury service date?\n        \nJurors must complete the qualification questionnaire using the online portal or mailed letter version prior to submitting a rescheduling request. Reschedule requests can be submitted using the online portal or by completing the Other Information section on the bottom of the mailed questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I request to be excused from jury service?\n        \nJurors must complete the qualification questionnaire using the online portal or mailed letter version prior to submitting an excusal request. Excusal requests can be submitted using the online portal or by completing the excusal section on the bottom of the mailed questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Who can be excused from jury service?\n        \nN.J.S.A. 2B:20-10 sets forth grounds for which a person can request to be excused from jury service. You may request to be excused from jury service you if fall into one of the categories below.\n\nYou are 75 years of age or older.\n\tYou will be required to provide your DOB the Jury Management Office.\n\t\nYou have served as a juror in the same county within the last three years.\n\tYou will be required to provide the date you served.\n\t\nYou believe that you will suffer a severe financial hardship.\n\tIn order to be excused for financial reasons, you must show that serving as a juror will cause a severe financial hardship that will compromise your ability to support yourself and/or your dependents. You will also be required to submit to the Jury Management Office a certification (sworn statement) listing the sources of your household income; whether you will be paid during jury service; and the impact of the length of service.\n\n\tJurors who report for service may speak with the trial judge regarding any financial hardships based on the anticipated length of the trial.\n\t\nYou have a medical inability to serve as a juror.\n\tIf you suffer from a medical condition that is unlikely to change within a year, and this condition prevents you from serving on jury duty, you may request to be excused or rescheduled. You and your doctor will be required to complete the Physician certification in Support of Medical Excuse Request certification. The Judiciary will also accept a note from a doctor that states the juror has a medical condition and the duration that this condition prevents them from serving jury duty. The court may request additional, non-confidential information if necessary to determine a request for an excusal.\n\t\nYou care for a minor child, or a sick, aged, or infirm dependent, and have no alternative care available without suffering severe financial hardship.\n\tWhen requesting to be excused for any of these circumstances, keep in mind that the Jury Management Office will grant you time to arrange for alternative care. Please be aware that the Judiciary will accommodate mothers who are breastfeeding and will provide a suitable private location for their use during the day.\n\n\tThe Jury Management Office will also require supplemental documentation for excusal requests as indicated below:\n\t\nIf you are requesting an excuse based upon a personal obligation to care for a sick, aged, or infirm dependent, you must submit a doctors note from a licensed physician stating that you are the sole caregiver and your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of that person.\n\t\t\nIf you are requesting an excuse based upon a personal obligation to care for a minor child or children, you must submit to the Jury Management Office the certification which states you are personally obligated to care for the minor child(ren). By completing this certification, you acknowledge that the court may require further information and/or financial documentation in support of the request.\n\t\t\n\n\nYou provide highly specialized technical healthcare services for which a replacement cannot reasonably be obtained.\n\tThe Jury Management Office will require proof of licensing as a healthcare provider and a letter from your employer verifying that no coverage can be reasonably obtained.\n\t\nYou are a healthcare worker directly involved in the care of a person with a mental or physical disability, and your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of that person.\n\tYou will be required to provide a letter from your employer verifying that your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of the person.\n\t\nYou are full-time teacher of a grammar/high school during the school year for which a replacement cannot be reasonably obtained.\n\tYou will be required to submit a letter from your school superintendent confirming you are full time instructional staff and indicating either an excuse is necessary due to the volume of teachers called at the time or you are a special education teacher and it is essential for you to be in attendance.\n\n\tOther teachers who cannot find a replacement, may reschedule their service.\n\t\nYou are an active member of a volunteer fire department, fire patrol, first aid or rescue squad.\n\tThe Jury Management Office will require a letter on letterhead from your fire captain/EMT squad captain; or identification showing active volunteer status (must not be expired).\n\t\nYou are on active duty as a member of the United States military.\n\tIn order to be excused from jury service, you must be on active duty on the summons date and the military service must be in the United States military, which includes members of the National Guard who are assigned to active duty.\n\n\tYou should provide information relating to your current assignment, such as a copy of your orders, a letter from your commanding officer, or a copy of your ID card indicating an active duty assignment.\n\nThe Judiciary thanks you for your service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What should I do if I feel sick?\n        \nIf you feel sick, do not report to the courthouse. Instead, contact your local jury management office to reschedule your service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Do I get paid for on-demand orientation?\n        \nNo, jurors participating in the on-demand orientation do not receive compensation for completing that online orientation. The on-demand orientation is designed to be a convenient alternative for jurors instead of in-person orientation. It allows you to prepare for jury service at your convenience, without the need to physically report to a courthouse. We appreciate your commitment to civic duty by participating in the on-demand orientation. You will be compensated for the portions of your jury service that follow the on-line orientation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. I received a Juror Summons for a family member that has passed. What should I do?\n        \nIf you receive a Juror Summons or Juror Questionnaire addressed to a person who is deceased, please contact the summoning Jury Management Office. This will allow the Judiciary to make the record ineligible for future selection.\nBy law, the Judiciary annually receives records from the New Jersey Department of Taxation, Motor Vehicle Commission, and Division of Elections for the master jury list. Please make sure to notify those agencies to avoid a record mistakenly coming to the Judiciary in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I know if I need to report for jury duty?\n        \nTo determine if you are required to report for jury duty, visit the Juror Reporting Pageafter 5:00 p.m. the evening before your summons date.\nJurors may also receive email or text messages regarding their service. This service is not available to jurors who opted out of receiving messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What are the different types of juror service in New Jersey?\n        \nYou may be summoned for one of three types of jury service. You may be summoned to serve as a Petit Juror, a Grand Juror, or a State Grand Juror.\n\nPetit Jury service includes criminal and civil trials. Petit jurors who sit on a criminal trial decide guilt or innocence in a criminal matter. Petit jurors who sit on a civil trial decide liability or damages.\nGrand Jury determine whether there is enough evidence to move forward with criminal charges against a defendant.\nState Grand Jury and county grand jury operate similarly but the State Grand Jury has statewide jurisdiction and representation and meets in Trenton rather than one of the county seats.\n\nPlease also be aware that you may be summoned to serve as a federal petit juror or grand juror in U.S. District Court. Such service is independent of N.J. Superior Court jury service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Is there a dress code for jurors reporting?\n        \nJurors reporting for service should wear clothing appropriate for an appearance in court. Shorts, t-shirts, uniforms or clothing containing statements or offensive symbols are not permitted. All hats must be removed when in a courtroom. Comfortable clothing is also advisable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Where does the list of jurors come from?\n        \nThe Judiciary is required by statute to create a single list for juror selection that combines names of registered voters, licensed drivers, filers of N.J. personal income tax returns.\nCitizens can assist in this process by using their legal name when filing relevant forms and checking to ensure that all information, including address and identifiers, is accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q.

Does recent service as a federal juror affect my scheduled service in the New Jersey Superior Court?\n        \nRecent service as a federal juror does not automatically relieve you from your petit jury civic obligation but you may provide that information to your summoning Jury Management Office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Where can I find public transportation information and/or driving directions for Juror Service?\n        \n\nPublic transportation information can be found on the NJ Transit website.\nSpecific destination and parking information for jurors is available on the jury reporting page for your county.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q.

Also, be aware that all metal objects will activate the metal detector and will need to be placed in the trays before passing through the metal detector. If the metal detector is activated as you pass through, you will be screened by an officer using a handheld metal detector. Purses and other carried items, such as briefcases and backpacks will be x-rayed. Any illegal items will be confiscated. The fewer metal items you are carrying, the faster you will pass through the screening process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Why do I seem to get summoned for jury duty more frequently than others?\n        \nEach juror record has the same chance of being selected at any time. As a result, some jurors may find they are summoned more frequently than others. If you have been summoned in the same county within the past three years, you may request to be excused from jury service. Please see \"How do I request to be excused from jury service?\" for instructions on requesting an excusal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q.

Consistentwith the laws text, however, all registrants including juveniles mustsatisfy the second requirement -- the public safety requirement -- to beeligible to terminate their obligations under Megans Law.

This will let you determine if the judiciary has the record.\nTypes of Copies and Court Authentication\nPlain Copy: A plain copy is a photocopy of the court document.\nCertified Copy: A certified copy is a plain copy with a stamp affixed with the Superior Court Clerk/Deputy Clerk's signature attesting to the authenticity of the document.\nSeal of the Court: The seal of the Superior Court may be affixed to a certified copy.\nExemplified Copy: An exemplified copy includes the attestation of the clerk and seal of the court annexed, if a seal exists, together with a certificate of a judge of the court that the said attestation is in proper form. An exemplified copy is usually requested when the document shall be proved or admitted in other courts within the United States and its Territories and Possessions.\nTriple Exemplified Copy: A triple exemplified copy contains an additional certification in which the judge certifies as to the form of the attestation in the verification and the authority of the Clerk of the Court who signed the exemplification, and the Clerk certifies as to the authority of the judge.\nApostille: An Apostille is provided attesting to the legal status of selected public officials, such as Judges, Clerks of Court and County Clerks. It is provided if the transaction involves a country that subscribes to the Hague Treaty and is processed through theNew Jersey Division of Revenue. A requester must first receive the exemplified copy from the Superior Court Clerk's Office and forward to the Division of Revenue.\n\nNOTE: We will need time and staff to find your records. Records stored off-site might take longer to retrieve. Some requests will be sent to local management for handling. This includes very large requests. It also includes requests to receive records on a regular basis. Judiciary staff must balance the need for public access and the Judiciarys need for efficient court operations. They will work with you to come up with a reasonable timeframe for your request.\nLocating Divorce Records\nIn New Jersey, divorce cases (termed \"dissolution cases\" by the courts) are filed and heard in the Family Division of the Superior Court at the county court level. After a case is completed and a judgment of divorce issued, the case is closed. Records for closed divorce cases are stored and archived by the Superior Court Clerk's Office at our warehouse in Trenton. The number of years between the time a case is closed and the time the case records are transferred to the Superior Court Clerks Office for archiving varies from county to county.\nIn many circumstances it may not be necessary to obtain a copy of the actual Judgment of Divorce. The Superior Court Clerks Office can prepare a Certificate of Divorce for a nominal fee. The certificate contains the county of venue, docket number, names of the parties and date of the Final Judgment of Divorce, and is stamped with the Seal of the Superior Court.\nThe Dissolution Files Inventory chart below shows the inventory of divorce case files currently stored at the RIC. The \"Case Year\" refers to the most recent docket year sent for storage at the RIC. This means that all divorce records up to and including the year listed under \"Case Year\" are available at the RIC.\nTo determine whether your case file is located at the RIC you must know both the county in which the divorce case took place and the year the case was filed. This information can be determined from the docket number assigned to the case. The docket number will have either an \"FM\" or \"M\" pre-fix followed by a 7- or 9-digit number. The last two digits of the docket number indicate the case year. See the following for examples of docket numbers:\n\nExample 1: \"FM-01-07500-00\" would mean that the divorce case was filed in Atlantic County (\"01\") in the year 2000 (\"00\"). (Please note, when the docket number contains 9 digits, the first two digits may represent the county code. The two-digit county codes are listed on the chart below after the name of each county.)\nExample 2: \"Atlantic County, M-07500-85\" would mean that the divorce case was filed in Atlantic County in 1985 (\"85\").\n\nNOTE: If you do not know your docket number, please contact theCustomer Service Unit of\n\n Superior Court Clerk's Office\n\n\nat\n\n 609-421-6100\n\n\n.\n\nA search can be conducted for your docket number if you provide the following information: the county where the divorce occurred, the approximate year the divorce occurred, and the names of the parties involved.\nUsing the case docket number, find the county where the divorce case took place and the corresponding case year in the chart below. If your divorce case falls within the records listed in the chart, contact Customer Service about viewing your case or to obtain copies of case documents. Refer to our information onCopies of Court Recordsand subsequent authentication and/orcopy fees.\nIf your divorce case file is not at the RIC in Trenton, contact theFamily Divisionof the county court in which the divorce took place for information on how to obtain a copy.\nDissolution Files Inventory\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Number\n\n\nCounty\n\n\nCase Year\n\n\n\n\n\n01\nAtlantic\n2012\n\n\n02\nBergen\n2015\n\n\n03\nBurlington\n2014\n\n\n04\nCamden\n2017\n\n\n05\nCape May\n2011\n\n\n06\nCumberland\n2008\n\n\n07\nEssex\n2019\n\n\n08\nGloucester\n2016\n\n\n09\nHudson\n2015\n\n\n10\nHunterdon\n2013\n\n\n11\nMercer\n2023\n\n\n12\nMiddlesex\n2019**\n\n\n13\nMonmouth\n2009\n\n\n14\nMorris\n2017\n\n\n15\nOcean\n2011\n\n\n16\nPassaic\n2009\n\n\n17\nSalem\n2017\n\n\n18\nSomerset\n2014\n\n\n19\nSussex\n2019\n\n\n20\nUnion\n2017\n\n\n21\nWarren\n2016*\n\n\n\n\n* FM  1989 Boxes (1&2) lost in Transit by Contract Messenger\n** FM  2017 (Entire year) was destroyed in a flood.\nLocating Adoption Records\nAdoption records are not public records in the State of New Jersey. Refer to N.J. CourtRule 1:38-3(16). All judgments of adoption and all records of proceedings relating to adoption are sealed, which means that they are not open to inspection, copying or otherwise made public except upon order of the court. (N.J.S.A. 9:3-51 and 52.) The Surrogates Court in each county enters judgments of adoption, places adoption records under seal and maintains these records.\nIn order for an adoption record to be opened, an order must be obtained from a judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Family Part. This usually involves filing a notarized petition with the Surrogate and paying the required fees; however procedures may vary depending on the county in which the request is being made.\nTo obtain specific information on filing procedures for obtaining adoption records, contact theSurrogates Officein the county in which you believe the adoption took place. The Surrogates Office can advise you on the necessary procedures and filing fees in connection with petitioning the court to open adoption records.\nCopy and Authentication Fees\nPlain Copies:\n\n\n\n\nLetter size pages\n$0.05\n\n\nLegal size pages\n$0.07\n\n\nCertified Copy\n$15\n\n\nSeal of the Court\n$10\n\n\nExemplified Copy: plus the plain copy fees\n$50\n\n\nTriple Exemplified Copy\n$60\n\n\nCertificate of Statewide Judgment Lien\n$10\n\n\nCertificate of Divorce\n$10\n\n\nCertified Copy of Final Judgment of Divorce\n$25\n\n\n\n\n*NOTE: When requesting copies of judgments of divorce, the terms of property settlement agreements are not always contained within or attached to the judgment. Additional copy fees may apply to a property settlement agreement that is not contained within the judgment of divorce.\nMethods of Payment for Copy Fees\nPayment for fees is accepted in the form of check and money order; cash is only accepted in person only. Checks/money orders must be payable toTreasurer-State of New Jersey.\nNOTE: Only checks with pre-printed names will be accepted. Attorneys may use their Superior Court Attorney Collateral Account to pay for copies. Since for plain copies the copy fee is based on the number of pages, we cannot determine the exact fee for copies until the request is processed. Please ensure that you provide a daytime telephone number on your copy request form so that we can inform you of the copy fee for your request.\nHow to Request Copies of Court Records\nPlease complete aRecords Request Formand submit through theJudiciary Electronic Document system.
