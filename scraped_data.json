If you are selected as a grand juror, you will serve one day a week for 16 to 20 weeks. State Grand Jury is managed by the Mercer County Jury Management Office.\nComplete the required questionnaire promptly.\n\nOnce you receive your State Grand Jury summons, you MUST complete the qualification questionnaire at least 30 days prior to your reporting date.\nEnter the 10-digit Participant ID number shown under the barcode (Not the Juror Number) of your summons, and your mailing address zip code listed on the summons.\nThrough this questionnaire, you can request to be disqualified, excused, or rescheduled (deferred).\nOnce you have entered all your answers, you must select \"Confirm,\" or your information will not be received and correctly processed.\nIf you are submitting the qualification questionnaire by mail, please make sure to include your email address and contact phone number in the required fields on the form.\nRequests\nIf you are requesting to be disqualified, excused, or rescheduled, you can send supporting documentation to\n           sgjury.mailbox@njcourts.gov\n\n    \n, or mail it to the\n\nMercer County Civil Courthouse\n\n        175 South Broad Street\n        \n    \n                                                            \n                                            Floor 2\n                                                            \n            \n            Trenton, New Jersey\n        08650-0068\n        \n\n\nDocumentation must be received by the jury management office at least 30 days prior to your summons date.\nState grand jurors are currently selected virtually using the following process:\n\nStep 1 - Jury summonses are mailed to potential state grand jurors. Jurors must complete the qualification questionnaire. Those who do not promptly respond online will be sent a questionnaire in the mail.\nStep 2 - About one month prior to the service date, only 100 potential jurors will be selected to appear from all those who responded and were qualified to serve. An email will be sent to all qualified jurors informing them whether they have been selected and must appear, or they were not selected and are excused.\nStep 3 - The Mercer County Jury Management Office will email jurors Zoom instructions prior to the appearance date.\nStep 4 - The Mercer County Jury Management Office will email jurors a Zoom invitation link for virtual jury selection the day before the appearance date.\n\u00a0If you have questions and would like to speak with someone by phone, you can call\u00a0\n           609-571-4200 ext. 74375\n            \n    \n\u00a0or send an email to\n\n           sgjury.mailbox@njcourts.gov\n\n    \n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "child_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/general-jury-information", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/contact", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/reporting", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq", "https://www.njcourts.gov/excusal-requests", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/service", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors", "https://www.njcourts.gov/rescheduling-requests", "https://www.njcourts.gov/videoconference-instructions", "https://www.njcourts.gov/new-jersey-state-grand-jury"], "isFile": false, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/videoconference-instructions": {"title": "Videoconference Instructions | NJ Courts", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideoconference Instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Jurors\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nComplete Your Questionnaire\n\n\nContact Jury Manager\n\n\nExcusal Requests\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nGeneral Jury Information\n\n\nRescheduling Requests\n\n\nNew Jersey State Grand Jury\n\n\nReporting Information\n\n\nVideoconference Instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Jurors\n\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nComplete Your Questionnaire\n\n\nContact Jury Manager\n\n\nExcusal Requests\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nGeneral Jury Information\n\n\nRescheduling Requests\n\n\nNew Jersey State Grand Jury\n\n\nReporting Information\n\n\nVideoconference Instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Jurors should check their county's reporting page (Reporting Information | NJ Courts) to determine if they need to report virtually or in-person.

I received a Juror Summons. What should I do?\n        \nIf you received a summons, the first step is to complete the qualification questionnaire. Jurors can complete the qualification questionnaire using the online portal or using the mailed letter version.\nJurors who do not have the ability to submit the online qualification questionnaire will automatically be mailed a printed version. The printed qualification questionnaire can be filled out in writing and mailed or emailed back to the county Jury Management office.\nAll jurors must complete the qualification questionnaire even if you are making a request to be excused or rescheduled.\nAfter completing the questionnaire, check the Jury Reporting page the night before your summons date for instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I log into the juror portal?\n        \n\nDo not set up a new account. An account is already set up for you.\nUse the 10-digit Participant ID and 5-digit zip code from your summons to log into the My Jury Service portal.\nYour User ID is your 10-digit Participant ID (include all zeros. e.g. 0001234567).\nYour Password is your 5-digit zip code.\nFor more information on logging into the MyJuryService Portal visit: Quick Reference Guide \u2013 My Jury Service (MJS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What should I do if I lost my Juror Questionnaire/Summons?\n        \nIf you misplace your Juror Summons or Juror Questionnaire, you should contact the Jury Management Office in your county for a replacement.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I update my address?\n        \nJurors may update their address two ways:\n\nJurors who completed their Juror Questionnaire online can update their address through the juror portal under the personal contact information section.\nJurors mailing in the printed version of the Juror Questionnaire can update their address on this form under the \u201cOther Information\u201d section. Check the box for address change and write your new address on the line provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Is my employer required to pay me when I have jury service?\n        \nIn New Jersey there is no statutory requirement that a private employer pay your salary during juror service. Whether or not your employer pays you for jury duty depends on your employment situation, including employers' policies, union contracts, etc. The State of New Jersey will pay you the appropriate juror fee as set forth in the New Jersey statutes. The Jury Management Office is aware that many employers do not pay their employees during jury duty. If service as a juror will create a severe financial hardship, as set forth in N.J.S.A. 2B:20-10, you may request to be excused. But please be aware that nonpayment by your employer, by itself, is not a valid reason to be excused from service. Each situation will be reviewed individually.\nIf you are employed full time by the State of New Jersey, you will receive your usual compensation while you serve as a juror. However, in accordance with N.J.S.A. 2B:20-16 you will not receive juror payment. This law applies to persons employed full time by any agency, independent authority, instrumentality of the State of any political subdivision of the State (such as counties or municipalities). Jurors affected by this policy should notify the Jury Management Office when they report for service. If a check is issued to you in error, you will be required to return it to the Jury Management Office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Can I be penalized by my employer for serving on jury duty?\n        \nN.J.S.A. 2B:20.17 prohibits an employer from penalizing you because you serve as a juror. Penalties for a violation of this statute include the possibility of a criminal charge, as a disorderly person\u2019s offense, and a possible civil action for monetary damages and for reinstatement of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What are the penalties for failing to report for jury service?\n        \nFailure to respond to the summons will result in further court action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How will I know if the court is closed due to inclement weather?\n        \nDuring inclement weather situations, all jurors, should check the State Court Closing Information\u00a0page prior to reporting to the courthouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What should I do if I am summoned but no longer live in the county that summoned me or in New Jersey?\n        \nIf you no longer live in New Jersey or received a Juror Summons from a county you no longer reside in, you must complete the Juror Questionnaire. You will be asked about your residency on question one.\nCompleting the Juror Questionnaire will allow the Jury Management Office to update your jury system record, which will prevent later enforcement efforts if there is no response to the summons (since N.J statutes require a response).\nThe Judiciary is required, for jury selection purposes, to merge lists of registered voters, licensed drivers, New Jersey personal income tax filers. Non-residents can be summoned when changes are delayed during list processing or if record holders have not updated their records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Can I collect unemployment while serving as a juror for New Jersey?\n        \nYou may still collect unemployment benefits while serving as a juror. N.J.S.A. 43:21-4(c)(5) protects a person's unemployment benefits during juror service. That statute states the following:\n\n(5) An unemployed individual, who is otherwise eligible, shall not be deemed unavailable for work or ineligible solely by reason of the individual's attendance before a court in response to a summons for service on a jury.\n\nIf an employment interview is scheduled on a day on which you need to report for juror service, notify the Jury Management Office, in advance if possible, and your service will be rescheduled to a later date. Please be aware that verification may be required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Why is it important that I serve as a juror?\n        \nJurors are an essential part of our justice system. The right to trial by jury in the United States dates from Colonial times and is rooted in English history. It is guaranteed by the Sixth and Seventh Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America and Article One of New Jersey\u2019s State Constitution. People have a right to have matters determined by a jury of their peers. Participating in our judicial system is not only an honor, but is also one of our civic duties. Although juror service may be inconvenient, citizens must participate in the jury process in order for it to work. Cases that go to trial need to be resolved by citizens who hear the evidence, determine the facts and render a verdict. It is impossible to get a fair cross-section of the community to participate in the jury system if people do not report for jury service. If you ever found yourself or a loved one involved in a civil or criminal trial, it's likely that you would want a jury of fellow citizens who will be fair and impartial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I reschedule my jury service date?\n        \nJurors must complete the qualification questionnaire using the online portal or mailed letter version prior to submitting a rescheduling request. Reschedule requests can be submitted using the online portal or by completing the \u201cOther Information\u201d section on the bottom of the mailed questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I request to be excused from jury service?\n        \nJurors must complete the qualification questionnaire using the online portal or mailed letter version prior to submitting an excusal request. Excusal requests can be submitted using the online portal or by completing the excusal section on the bottom of the mailed questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Who can be excused from jury service?\n        \nN.J.S.A. 2B:20-10 sets forth grounds for which a person can request to be excused from jury service. You may request to be excused from jury service you if fall into one of the categories below.\n\nYou are 75 years of age or older.\n\tYou will be required to provide your DOB the Jury Management Office.\n\t\u00a0\nYou have served as a juror in the same county within the last three years.\n\tYou will be required to provide the date you served.\n\t\u00a0\nYou believe that you will suffer a severe financial hardship.\n\tIn order to be excused for financial reasons, you must show that serving as a juror will cause a severe financial hardship that will compromise your ability to support yourself and/or your dependents. You will also be required to submit to the Jury Management Office a certification (sworn statement) listing the sources of your household income; whether you will be paid during jury service; and the impact of the length of service.\u00a0\n\n\tJurors who report for service may speak with the trial judge regarding any financial hardships based on the anticipated length of the trial.\n\t\u00a0\nYou have a medical inability to serve as a juror.\n\tIf you suffer from a medical condition that is unlikely to change within a year, and this condition prevents you from serving on jury duty, you may request to be excused or rescheduled. You and your doctor will be required to complete the Physician certification in Support of Medical Excuse Request certification. The Judiciary will also accept a note from a doctor that states the juror has a medical condition and the duration that this condition prevents them from serving jury duty. The court may request additional, non-confidential information if necessary to determine a request for an excusal.\n\t\u00a0\nYou care for a minor child, or a sick, aged, or infirm dependent, and have no alternative care available without suffering severe financial hardship.\n\tWhen requesting to be excused for any of these circumstances, keep in mind that the Jury Management Office will grant you time to arrange for alternative care. Please be aware that the Judiciary will accommodate mothers who are breastfeeding and will provide a suitable private location for their use during the day.\u00a0\n\n\tThe Jury Management Office will also require supplemental documentation for excusal requests as indicated below:\n\t\nIf you are requesting an excuse based upon a personal obligation to care for a sick, aged, or infirm dependent, you must submit a doctor\u2019s note from a licensed physician stating that you are the sole caregiver and your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of that person.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIf you are requesting an excuse based upon a personal obligation to care for a minor child or children, you must submit to the Jury Management Office the certification which states you are personally obligated to care for the minor child(ren). By completing this certification, you acknowledge that the court may require further information and/or financial documentation in support of the request.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nYou provide highly specialized technical healthcare services for which a replacement cannot reasonably be obtained.\n\tThe Jury Management Office will require proof of licensing as a healthcare provider and a letter from your employer verifying that no coverage can be reasonably obtained.\n\t\u00a0\nYou are a healthcare worker directly involved in the care of a person with a mental or physical disability, and your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of that person.\n\tYou will be required to provide a letter from your employer verifying that your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of the person.\n\t\u00a0\nYou are full-time teacher of a grammar/high school during the school year for which a replacement cannot be reasonably obtained.\n\tYou will be required to submit a letter from your school superintendent confirming you are full time instructional staff and indicating either an excuse is necessary due to the volume of teachers called at the time or you are a special education teacher and it is essential for you to be in attendance.\u00a0\n\n\tOther teachers who cannot find a replacement, may reschedule their service.\n\t\u00a0\nYou are an active member of a volunteer fire department, fire patrol, first aid or rescue squad.\n\tThe Jury Management Office will require a letter on letterhead from your fire captain/EMT squad captain; or identification showing active volunteer status (must not be expired).\n\t\u00a0\nYou are on active duty as a member of the United States military.\n\tIn order to be excused from jury service, you must be on active duty on the summons date and the military service must be in the United States military, which includes members of the National Guard who are assigned to active duty.\n\n\tYou should provide information relating to your current assignment, such as a copy of your orders, a letter from your commanding officer, or a copy of your ID card indicating an active duty assignment.\n\nThe Judiciary thanks you for your service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Do I get paid for on-demand orientation?\n        \nNo, jurors participating in the on-demand orientation do not receive compensation for completing that online orientation. \u00a0The on-demand orientation is designed to be a convenient alternative for jurors instead of in-person orientation. It allows you to prepare for jury service at your convenience, without the need to physically report to a courthouse. \u00a0We appreciate your commitment to civic duty by participating in the on-demand orientation. \u00a0You will be compensated for the portions of your jury service that follow the on-line orientation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What should I do if I feel sick?\n        \nIf you feel sick, do not report to the courthouse. Instead, contact your local jury management office to reschedule your service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Does recent service as a federal juror affect my scheduled service in the New Jersey Superior Court?\n        \nRecent service as a federal juror does not automatically relieve you from your petit jury civic obligation but you may provide that information to your summoning Jury Management Office.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Where can I find public transportation information and/or driving directions for Juror Service?\n        \n\nPublic transportation information can be found on the NJ Transit website.\nSpecific destination and parking information for jurors is available on the jury reporting page for your county.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How are prospective jurors selected to be summoned?\n        \nProspective jurors are randomly selected by computer. If selected, a juror is mailed a green postcard summons. In certain instances, jurors will also be mailed a follow-up notice that includes a printed Juror Questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How can I obtain proof that I served as a juror?\n        \nJurors who completed the Juror Qualification Questionnaire online can print an attendance letter through the juror portal. If you are unable to your print letter from the portal, your  Jury Management Office  can provide you with an attendance letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Does recent service in another state excuse me from serving as a juror in New Jersey?\n        \nRecent service in another state does not excuse you from serving in New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Will I be screened for weapons when entering the Superior Court Courthouse?\n        \nIn order to ensure the safety of those entering NJ courthouses, all persons, including jurors, are screened when entering a NJ Superior Court courthouse. Chemical agents, pepper sprays, or anything resembling a weapon, including scissors, will not be permitted into the Courthouse - for the safety of the public. Also, be aware that all metal objects will activate the metal detector and will need to be placed in the trays before passing through the metal detector. If the metal detector is activated as you pass through, you will be screened by an officer using a handheld metal detector. Purses and other carried items, such as briefcases and backpacks will be x-rayed. Any illegal items will be confiscated. The fewer metal items you are carrying, the faster you will pass through the screening process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Why do I seem to get summoned for jury duty more frequently than others?\n        \nEach juror record has the same chance of being selected at any time. As a result, some jurors may find they are summoned more frequently than others. If you have been summoned in the same county within the past three years, you may request to be excused from jury service. Please see \"How do I request to be excused from jury service?\" for instructions on requesting an excusal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. When will I get paid for jury service in New Jersey?\n        \nJuror payrolls are processed each Friday, except holidays. Therefore, a juror may receive more than one check if that juror served in different weeks.\nJurors paid $600 or more for their term of service will receive a 1099 form for taxes from the New Jersey Department of the Treasury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What are the qualifications to serve as a juror in New Jersey?\n        \nN.J.S.A. 2B:20-1 establishes six criteria for a person to qualify for jury service:\n\nbe a resident of New Jersey;\nbe a citizen of the United States;\nbe physically and mentally able to perform the functions of a juror (noting that the Judiciary will provide accommodations consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act);\nhave no conviction for an indictable offense\n\t\nExamples of persons who would be disqualified are anyone who was convicted of, or pled guilty to, a crime in Federal Court or Superior Court; or anyone currently on PTI (Pre-trial Intervention Program.)\nExamples of persons who would qualify to serve jury duty are anyone whose only convictions are in Municipal Court (most traffic violations fall into this category, as do most shoplifting charges;) or anyone who has been accused of a crime but has not yet been convicted or has yet to enter a guilty plea.\nAlso, traffic offenses, juvenile and DWI related offenses that occurred in New Jersey are not grounds for disqualification.\nYou are not disqualified with respect to criminal record if you successfully completed a Pre-Trial Intervention program (PTI) for an offense and have not been convicted or pled guilty to another disqualifying offense.\n\n\nbe at least 18 years of age; and\nbe able to read and understand the English language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. I received a Juror Summons for a family member that has passed. What should I do?\n        \nIf you receive a Juror Summons or Juror Questionnaire addressed to a person who is deceased, please contact the summoning Jury Management Office. This will allow the Judiciary to make the record ineligible for future selection.\nBy law, the Judiciary annually receives records from the New Jersey Department of Taxation, Motor Vehicle Commission, and Division of Elections for the master jury list. Please make sure to notify those agencies to avoid a record mistakenly coming to the Judiciary in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I know if I need to report for jury duty?\n        \nTo determine if you are required to report for jury duty, visit the Juror Reporting Page\u00a0after 5:00 p.m. the evening before your summons date.\nJurors may also receive email or text messages regarding their service. This service is not available to jurors who opted out of receiving messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What are the different types of juror service in New Jersey?\n        \nYou may be summoned for one of three types of jury service. You may be summoned to serve as a Petit Juror, a Grand Juror, or a State Grand Juror.\n\nPetit Jury service includes criminal and civil trials. Petit jurors who sit on a criminal trial decide guilt or innocence in a criminal matter. Petit jurors who sit on a civil trial decide liability or damages.\nGrand Jury determine whether there is enough evidence to move forward with criminal charges against a defendant.\nState Grand Jury and county grand jury operate similarly but the State Grand Jury has statewide jurisdiction and representation and meets in Trenton rather than one of the county seats.\n\nPlease also be aware that you may be summoned to serve as a federal petit juror or grand juror in U.S. District Court. Such service is independent of N.J. Superior Court jury service.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Is there a dress code for jurors reporting?\n        \nJurors reporting for service should wear clothing appropriate for an appearance in court. Shorts, t-shirts, uniforms or clothing containing statements or offensive symbols are not permitted. All hats must be removed when in a courtroom. Comfortable clothing is also advisable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Where does the list of jurors come from?\n        \nThe Judiciary is required by statute to create a single list for juror selection that combines names of registered voters, licensed drivers, filers of N.J. personal income tax returns.\nCitizens can assist in this process by using their legal name when filing relevant forms and checking to ensure that all information, including address and identifiers, is accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How much do I get paid for jury service?\n        \nPetit jurors are paid $5 dollars for each day of service. If a petit juror serves more than three days, the pay rate will increase to $40 per day beginning on the fourth day.\nGrand jurors are paid $5 dollars for each day of service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "child_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/general-jury-information", "https://www.njcourts.gov/rescheduling-requests", "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/jurors/quickreferenceguide-jury.pdf", "https://www.njcourts.gov/public/news-media/court-closings", "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12308_physician_cert.pdf", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq#493196", "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12140_jury_duty_childcare.pdf", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/contact", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/reporting", "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12255_jury_financial_hardship.pdf", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq", "https://www.njcourts.gov/excusal-requests", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/service", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors", "https://www.njcourts.gov/", "https://www.njcourts.gov/videoconference-instructions", "https://www.njcourts.gov/new-jersey-state-grand-jury"], "isFile": false, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/excusal-requests"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12255_jury_financial_hardship.pdf": {"title": "12255_jury_financial_hardship.pdf", "text": "", "child_pages": [], "isFile": true, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/reporting": {"title": "Reporting Information | NJ Courts", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReporting Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\nJurors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you feel sick, do not report to the courthouse.\u00a0 Instead, contact your local jury management office to reschedule your service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Jury Reporting\n\n\n\n\nState Grand Jury\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlantic\n\n\nBergen\n\n\nBurlington\n\n\nCamden\n\n\nCape May\n\n\nCumberland\n\n\nEssex\n\n\n\n\nGloucester\n\n\nHudson\n\n\nHunterdon\n\n\nMercer\n\n\nMiddlesex\n\n\nMonmouth\n\n\nMorris\n\n\n\n\nOcean\n\n\nPassaic\n\n\nSalem\n\n\nSomerset\n\n\nSussex\n\n\nUnion\n\n\nWarren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "child_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/gloucester", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/atlantic", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/passaic", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/sussex", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/middlesex", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/ocean", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/camden", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/cumberland", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/union", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/mercer", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/bergen", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/warren", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/essex", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/state-grand-jury", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/morris", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/somerset", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/hudson", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/burlington", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/monmouth", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/hunterdon", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/contact", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/salem", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/cape-may", "https://www.njcourts.gov/"], "isFile": false, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/cape-may": {"title": "Cape May County Reporting Information", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCape May County Reporting Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Reporting Information\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nAtlantic\n\n\nBergen\n\n\nBurlington\n\n\nCamden\n\n\nCape May\n\n\nCumberland\n\n\nEssex\n\n\nGloucester\n\n\nHudson\n\n\nHunterdon\n\n\nMercer\n\n\nMiddlesex\n\n\nMonmouth\n\n\nMorris\n\n\nOcean\n\n\nPassaic\n\n\nSalem\n\n\nSomerset\n\n\nSussex\n\n\nUnion\n\n\nWarren\n\n\nState Grand Jury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Reporting Information\n\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nAtlantic\n\n\nBergen\n\n\nBurlington\n\n\nCamden\n\n\nCape May\n\n\nCumberland\n\n\nEssex\n\n\nGloucester\n\n\nHudson\n\n\nHunterdon\n\n\nMercer\n\n\nMiddlesex\n\n\nMonmouth\n\n\nMorris\n\n\nOcean\n\n\nPassaic\n\n\nSalem\n\n\nSomerset\n\n\nSussex\n\n\nUnion\n\n\nWarren\n\n\nState Grand Jury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Cape May County MessagePetit Jurors\u00a0 -

If a check is issued to you in error, you will be required to return it to the Jury Management Office directly.\nEmployers Are Not Required to Pay Staff During Jury Service\nIn New Jersey there is no statutory requirement that a private employer pay your salary during juror service. It is in your best interest to speak with your employer before your summons date to determine whether your employer offers juror pay and for the number of days provided for jury service.\u00a0\nEmployers Cannot Penalize You for Jury Service\nN.J.S.A. 2B:20.17 prohibits an employer from penalizing you because you serve as a juror. Penalties for a violation of this statute include the possibility of a criminal charge, as a disorderly person\u2019s offense, and a possible civil action for monetary damages and for reinstatement of employment. \u00a0\nJuror Qualification\nN.J.S.A. 2B:20-1 establishes six criteria for a person to qualify for jury service:\n\nbe a resident of New Jersey;\nbe\u00a0a citizen of the United States;\nbe\u00a0physically and mentally able to perform the functions of a juror (noting that the Judiciary will provide accommodations consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act);\nhave no conviction for an indictable offense\n\t\u00a0\n\t\nExamples of persons who would be disqualified are anyone who was convicted of, or pled guilty to, a crime in federal court or Superior Court; or anyone currently in the Pretrial Intervention Program (PTI).\nExamples of persons who would qualify to serve jury duty are anyone whose only convictions are in municipal court (most traffic violations fall into this category, as do most shoplifting charges;) or anyone who has been accused of a crime but has not yet been convicted or has yet to enter a guilty plea.\nAlso, traffic offenses, juvenile and DWI related offenses that occurred in New Jersey are not grounds for disqualification.\nYou are not disqualified with respect to criminal record if you successfully completed a PTI for an offense and have not been convicted or pled guilty to another disqualifying offense.\n\n\nbe at least 18 years of age; and\nbe able to read and understand the English language\n\nJuror Scams\nThe Judiciary will never ask for personal information or payments over the phone or by email. Contact your local jury management office if you have any concerns.\n\nThe Judiciary will never request personal identifiers (such as social security numbers) or payment (credit card, checking, savings account information, etc.) for a fine for not going to jury duty over the phone or by e-mail.\nIf you receive suspicious communication concerning jury duty, hang up and call or e-mail your local jury management office. If you believe you have been the victim of a jury duty scam, contact your local jury management office and law enforcement in your county.\n\nPhone Use in the Courtroom\nCellphone use in the courtroom is not permitted. \u00a0You must not take any photographs or digital images, including ZOOM displays, or make any audio or video recordings of any kind. \u00a0This includes broadcasting or posting any proceedings during your time in the courthouse.\n\nIf you are found to have violated this directive by creating a photograph, digital image, audio, video, or other recording, you may be subject to punishment under New Jersey law.\n\nPhones must be concealed at all times. \u00a0Exposed phones will be confiscated.\n\u00a0\nTypes of Jury Service & Payments\nPetit Jury Service\n\nQuestionnaires are required to be completed four days before the date of service.\nPetit jury is for civil and criminal trials. \u00a0Petit jurors listen to evidence presented by both parties during a trial and return a verdict.\nThe role of a juror is to listen to all the evidence presented and render a verdict at the end of the trial.\n12 jurors are typically selected for a civil or criminal trial.\nJurors are paid $5 for the first three days of attendance and $40 for each day after.\nWatch a video about jury service.\n\nGrand Jury Service\n\nQuestionnaires are required to be completed four days before the date of service.\nGrand jury examines allegations against a person or persons charged with a crime. Grand jury does not determine guilt or innocence, but whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime was committed.\nThe role of a grand juror is to determine whether there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime.\n23 jurors are selected to be on a panel.\nDepending upon the county, the term of service for a panel can be from eight weeks to 20 weeks long.\nJurors are paid\u00a0$5\u00a0for each day they attend.\n\nState Grand Jury Service\n\nQuestionnaires are required to be completed 35 days before the date of service.\nState Grand Jury is a statewide program with jurors summoned from every county in New Jersey.\u00a0\nIf you are one of the 23 jurors selected, you will serve one day per week for 16 to 20 weeks.\nState Grand Jury is managed by the Mercer County Jury Management Office. \u00a0\nJury selection will be held virtually, and a Zoom link will be emailed to you the day before your summons date. \u00a0\nIf you are selected as a juror, you will be required to appear at:\n\nRichard Hughes Justice Complex\n\tAdministrative Office of the Courts\n\t25 Market Street\u00a0\n\t4th Floor\n\tTrenton, NJ 08625\n\t\u00a0\nJurors are paid $5 for each day they attend.\n\nItems Not Permitted in the Courthouse\nTo ensure everyone\u2019s safety, all persons visiting the courthouse, including jurors, litigants, attorneys, employees, vendors, and other visitors, are subject to security screening when entering. Please allow sufficient time to pass through the court\u2019s security system, as you will be required to walk through metal detection equipment.\n\nIllegal items will be confiscated and may subject you to prosecution.\n\nProhibited Items:\n\nWeapons of any kind\nFirearms\nKnives of any size\nSharp objects, scissors, or cutting tools of any type\nPepper spray\nAerosol sprays or containers\nE-cigarettes or similar items\nAudio/visual equipment, including cameras, unless you have prior written permission from the court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "child_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/general-jury-information", "https://www.njcourts.gov/public/news-media/court-closings", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/contact", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/reporting", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq", "https://www.njcourts.gov/excusal-requests", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/service", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors", "https://www.njcourts.gov/rescheduling-requests", "https://www.njcourts.gov/videoconference-instructions", "https://www.njcourts.gov/new-jersey-state-grand-jury"], "isFile": false, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/contact"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/jury-reporting-messages/hunterdon": {"title": "Hunterdon County Reporting Information | NJ Courts", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHunterdon County Reporting Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Reporting Information\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nAtlantic\n\n\nBergen\n\n\nBurlington\n\n\nCamden\n\n\nCape May\n\n\nCumberland\n\n\nEssex\n\n\nGloucester\n\n\nHudson\n\n\nHunterdon\n\n\nMercer\n\n\nMiddlesex\n\n\nMonmouth\n\n\nMorris\n\n\nOcean\n\n\nPassaic\n\n\nSalem\n\n\nSomerset\n\n\nSussex\n\n\nUnion\n\n\nWarren\n\n\nState Grand Jury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Reporting Information\n\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nAtlantic\n\n\nBergen\n\n\nBurlington\n\n\nCamden\n\n\nCape May\n\n\nCumberland\n\n\nEssex\n\n\nGloucester\n\n\nHudson\n\n\nHunterdon\n\n\nMercer\n\n\nMiddlesex\n\n\nMonmouth\n\n\nMorris\n\n\nOcean\n\n\nPassaic\n\n\nSalem\n\n\nSomerset\n\n\nSussex\n\n\nUnion\n\n\nWarren\n\n\nState Grand Jury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHunterdon County Juror Reporting Message\nJury reporting information will be posted after 5:00 PM on the day before your first reporting date and each day thereafter until your service is complete.\nThis message is for petit jurors summoned for jury service October 15, 2024, in Hunterdon County:\nYour jury service scheduled to begin on Tuesday, October 15, 2024, is complete and you do not need to report for jury duty next week.\u00a0 Please report to your place of employment or follow your normal routine.\u00a0 This will satisfy your jury service requirement for a minimum of 3 years.\nThe Hunterdon County Superior Court Judges and Jury Management staff thank you for your time and availability to serve.\nPlease direct any inquiries to the Jury Management Office at 908-824-9750, x 13030.\nThe best way to contact the office is to send an email to hntjury.mbx@njcourts.gov\nFor updates on future jury service weeks or to check reporting messages please call 908-824-9755.\n\nThank you for your service!\u00a0\nThe New Jersey Judiciary does not and has never asked for juror\u2019s banking information or social security numbers over the phone, by email, or in person.

I received a Juror Summons. What should I do?\n        \nIf you received a summons, the first step is to complete the qualification questionnaire. Jurors can complete the qualification questionnaire using the online portal or using the mailed letter version.\nJurors who do not have the ability to submit the online qualification questionnaire will automatically be mailed a printed version. The printed qualification questionnaire can be filled out in writing and mailed or emailed back to the county Jury Management office.\nAll jurors must complete the qualification questionnaire even if you are making a request to be excused or rescheduled.\nAfter completing the questionnaire, check the Jury Reporting page the night before your summons date for instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I log into the juror portal?\n        \n\nDo not set up a new account. An account is already set up for you.\nUse the 10-digit Participant ID and 5-digit zip code from your summons to log into the My Jury Service portal.\nYour User ID is your 10-digit Participant ID (include all zeros. e.g. 0001234567).\nYour Password is your 5-digit zip code.\nFor more information on logging into the MyJuryService Portal visit: Quick Reference Guide \u2013 My Jury Service (MJS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What should I do if I lost my Juror Questionnaire/Summons?\n        \nIf you misplace your Juror Summons or Juror Questionnaire, you should contact the Jury Management Office in your county for a replacement.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I update my address?\n        \nJurors may update their address two ways:\n\nJurors who completed their Juror Questionnaire online can update their address through the juror portal under the personal contact information section.\nJurors mailing in the printed version of the Juror Questionnaire can update their address on this form under the \u201cOther Information\u201d section. Check the box for address change and write your new address on the line provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Is my employer required to pay me when I have jury service?\n        \nIn New Jersey there is no statutory requirement that a private employer pay your salary during juror service. Whether or not your employer pays you for jury duty depends on your employment situation, including employers' policies, union contracts, etc. The State of New Jersey will pay you the appropriate juror fee as set forth in the New Jersey statutes. The Jury Management Office is aware that many employers do not pay their employees during jury duty. If service as a juror will create a severe financial hardship, as set forth in N.J.S.A. 2B:20-10, you may request to be excused. But please be aware that nonpayment by your employer, by itself, is not a valid reason to be excused from service. Each situation will be reviewed individually.\nIf you are employed full time by the State of New Jersey, you will receive your usual compensation while you serve as a juror. However, in accordance with N.J.S.A. 2B:20-16 you will not receive juror payment. This law applies to persons employed full time by any agency, independent authority, instrumentality of the State of any political subdivision of the State (such as counties or municipalities). Jurors affected by this policy should notify the Jury Management Office when they report for service. If a check is issued to you in error, you will be required to return it to the Jury Management Office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Can I be penalized by my employer for serving on jury duty?\n        \nN.J.S.A. 2B:20.17 prohibits an employer from penalizing you because you serve as a juror. Penalties for a violation of this statute include the possibility of a criminal charge, as a disorderly person\u2019s offense, and a possible civil action for monetary damages and for reinstatement of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What are the penalties for failing to report for jury service?\n        \nFailure to respond to the summons will result in further court action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How will I know if the court is closed due to inclement weather?\n        \nDuring inclement weather situations, all jurors, should check the State Court Closing Information\u00a0page prior to reporting to the courthouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What should I do if I am summoned but no longer live in the county that summoned me or in New Jersey?\n        \nIf you no longer live in New Jersey or received a Juror Summons from a county you no longer reside in, you must complete the Juror Questionnaire. You will be asked about your residency on question one.\nCompleting the Juror Questionnaire will allow the Jury Management Office to update your jury system record, which will prevent later enforcement efforts if there is no response to the summons (since N.J statutes require a response).\nThe Judiciary is required, for jury selection purposes, to merge lists of registered voters, licensed drivers, New Jersey personal income tax filers. Non-residents can be summoned when changes are delayed during list processing or if record holders have not updated their records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Can I collect unemployment while serving as a juror for New Jersey?\n        \nYou may still collect unemployment benefits while serving as a juror. N.J.S.A. 43:21-4(c)(5) protects a person's unemployment benefits during juror service. That statute states the following:\n\n(5) An unemployed individual, who is otherwise eligible, shall not be deemed unavailable for work or ineligible solely by reason of the individual's attendance before a court in response to a summons for service on a jury.\n\nIf an employment interview is scheduled on a day on which you need to report for juror service, notify the Jury Management Office, in advance if possible, and your service will be rescheduled to a later date. Please be aware that verification may be required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Why is it important that I serve as a juror?\n        \nJurors are an essential part of our justice system. The right to trial by jury in the United States dates from Colonial times and is rooted in English history. It is guaranteed by the Sixth and Seventh Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America and Article One of New Jersey\u2019s State Constitution. People have a right to have matters determined by a jury of their peers. Participating in our judicial system is not only an honor, but is also one of our civic duties. Although juror service may be inconvenient, citizens must participate in the jury process in order for it to work. Cases that go to trial need to be resolved by citizens who hear the evidence, determine the facts and render a verdict. It is impossible to get a fair cross-section of the community to participate in the jury system if people do not report for jury service. If you ever found yourself or a loved one involved in a civil or criminal trial, it's likely that you would want a jury of fellow citizens who will be fair and impartial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I reschedule my jury service date?\n        \nJurors must complete the qualification questionnaire using the online portal or mailed letter version prior to submitting a rescheduling request. Reschedule requests can be submitted using the online portal or by completing the \u201cOther Information\u201d section on the bottom of the mailed questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I request to be excused from jury service?\n        \nJurors must complete the qualification questionnaire using the online portal or mailed letter version prior to submitting an excusal request. Excusal requests can be submitted using the online portal or by completing the excusal section on the bottom of the mailed questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Who can be excused from jury service?\n        \nN.J.S.A. 2B:20-10 sets forth grounds for which a person can request to be excused from jury service. You may request to be excused from jury service you if fall into one of the categories below.\n\nYou are 75 years of age or older.\n\tYou will be required to provide your DOB the Jury Management Office.\n\t\u00a0\nYou have served as a juror in the same county within the last three years.\n\tYou will be required to provide the date you served.\n\t\u00a0\nYou believe that you will suffer a severe financial hardship.\n\tIn order to be excused for financial reasons, you must show that serving as a juror will cause a severe financial hardship that will compromise your ability to support yourself and/or your dependents. You will also be required to submit to the Jury Management Office a certification (sworn statement) listing the sources of your household income; whether you will be paid during jury service; and the impact of the length of service.\u00a0\n\n\tJurors who report for service may speak with the trial judge regarding any financial hardships based on the anticipated length of the trial.\n\t\u00a0\nYou have a medical inability to serve as a juror.\n\tIf you suffer from a medical condition that is unlikely to change within a year, and this condition prevents you from serving on jury duty, you may request to be excused or rescheduled. You and your doctor will be required to complete the Physician certification in Support of Medical Excuse Request certification. The Judiciary will also accept a note from a doctor that states the juror has a medical condition and the duration that this condition prevents them from serving jury duty. The court may request additional, non-confidential information if necessary to determine a request for an excusal.\n\t\u00a0\nYou care for a minor child, or a sick, aged, or infirm dependent, and have no alternative care available without suffering severe financial hardship.\n\tWhen requesting to be excused for any of these circumstances, keep in mind that the Jury Management Office will grant you time to arrange for alternative care. Please be aware that the Judiciary will accommodate mothers who are breastfeeding and will provide a suitable private location for their use during the day.\u00a0\n\n\tThe Jury Management Office will also require supplemental documentation for excusal requests as indicated below:\n\t\nIf you are requesting an excuse based upon a personal obligation to care for a sick, aged, or infirm dependent, you must submit a doctor\u2019s note from a licensed physician stating that you are the sole caregiver and your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of that person.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIf you are requesting an excuse based upon a personal obligation to care for a minor child or children, you must submit to the Jury Management Office the certification which states you are personally obligated to care for the minor child(ren). By completing this certification, you acknowledge that the court may require further information and/or financial documentation in support of the request.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nYou provide highly specialized technical healthcare services for which a replacement cannot reasonably be obtained.\n\tThe Jury Management Office will require proof of licensing as a healthcare provider and a letter from your employer verifying that no coverage can be reasonably obtained.\n\t\u00a0\nYou are a healthcare worker directly involved in the care of a person with a mental or physical disability, and your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of that person.\n\tYou will be required to provide a letter from your employer verifying that your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of the person.\n\t\u00a0\nYou are full-time teacher of a grammar/high school during the school year for which a replacement cannot be reasonably obtained.\n\tYou will be required to submit a letter from your school superintendent confirming you are full time instructional staff and indicating either an excuse is necessary due to the volume of teachers called at the time or you are a special education teacher and it is essential for you to be in attendance.\u00a0\n\n\tOther teachers who cannot find a replacement, may reschedule their service.\n\t\u00a0\nYou are an active member of a volunteer fire department, fire patrol, first aid or rescue squad.\n\tThe Jury Management Office will require a letter on letterhead from your fire captain/EMT squad captain; or identification showing active volunteer status (must not be expired).\n\t\u00a0\nYou are on active duty as a member of the United States military.\n\tIn order to be excused from jury service, you must be on active duty on the summons date and the military service must be in the United States military, which includes members of the National Guard who are assigned to active duty.\n\n\tYou should provide information relating to your current assignment, such as a copy of your orders, a letter from your commanding officer, or a copy of your ID card indicating an active duty assignment.\n\nThe Judiciary thanks you for your service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Do I get paid for on-demand orientation?\n        \nNo, jurors participating in the on-demand orientation do not receive compensation for completing that online orientation. \u00a0The on-demand orientation is designed to be a convenient alternative for jurors instead of in-person orientation. It allows you to prepare for jury service at your convenience, without the need to physically report to a courthouse. \u00a0We appreciate your commitment to civic duty by participating in the on-demand orientation. \u00a0You will be compensated for the portions of your jury service that follow the on-line orientation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What should I do if I feel sick?\n        \nIf you feel sick, do not report to the courthouse. Instead, contact your local jury management office to reschedule your service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Does recent service as a federal juror affect my scheduled service in the New Jersey Superior Court?\n        \nRecent service as a federal juror does not automatically relieve you from your petit jury civic obligation but you may provide that information to your summoning Jury Management Office.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Where can I find public transportation information and/or driving directions for Juror Service?\n        \n\nPublic transportation information can be found on the NJ Transit website.\nSpecific destination and parking information for jurors is available on the jury reporting page for your county.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How are prospective jurors selected to be summoned?\n        \nProspective jurors are randomly selected by computer. If selected, a juror is mailed a green postcard summons. In certain instances, jurors will also be mailed a follow-up notice that includes a printed Juror Questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How can I obtain proof that I served as a juror?\n        \nJurors who completed the Juror Qualification Questionnaire online can print an attendance letter through the juror portal. If you are unable to your print letter from the portal, your  Jury Management Office  can provide you with an attendance letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Does recent service in another state excuse me from serving as a juror in New Jersey?\n        \nRecent service in another state does not excuse you from serving in New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Will I be screened for weapons when entering the Superior Court Courthouse?\n        \nIn order to ensure the safety of those entering NJ courthouses, all persons, including jurors, are screened when entering a NJ Superior Court courthouse. Chemical agents, pepper sprays, or anything resembling a weapon, including scissors, will not be permitted into the Courthouse - for the safety of the public. Also, be aware that all metal objects will activate the metal detector and will need to be placed in the trays before passing through the metal detector. If the metal detector is activated as you pass through, you will be screened by an officer using a handheld metal detector. Purses and other carried items, such as briefcases and backpacks will be x-rayed. Any illegal items will be confiscated. The fewer metal items you are carrying, the faster you will pass through the screening process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Why do I seem to get summoned for jury duty more frequently than others?\n        \nEach juror record has the same chance of being selected at any time. As a result, some jurors may find they are summoned more frequently than others. If you have been summoned in the same county within the past three years, you may request to be excused from jury service. Please see \"How do I request to be excused from jury service?\" for instructions on requesting an excusal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. When will I get paid for jury service in New Jersey?\n        \nJuror payrolls are processed each Friday, except holidays. Therefore, a juror may receive more than one check if that juror served in different weeks.\nJurors paid $600 or more for their term of service will receive a 1099 form for taxes from the New Jersey Department of the Treasury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What are the qualifications to serve as a juror in New Jersey?\n        \nN.J.S.A. 2B:20-1 establishes six criteria for a person to qualify for jury service:\n\nbe a resident of New Jersey;\nbe a citizen of the United States;\nbe physically and mentally able to perform the functions of a juror (noting that the Judiciary will provide accommodations consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act);\nhave no conviction for an indictable offense\n\t\nExamples of persons who would be disqualified are anyone who was convicted of, or pled guilty to, a crime in Federal Court or Superior Court; or anyone currently on PTI (Pre-trial Intervention Program.)\nExamples of persons who would qualify to serve jury duty are anyone whose only convictions are in Municipal Court (most traffic violations fall into this category, as do most shoplifting charges;) or anyone who has been accused of a crime but has not yet been convicted or has yet to enter a guilty plea.\nAlso, traffic offenses, juvenile and DWI related offenses that occurred in New Jersey are not grounds for disqualification.\nYou are not disqualified with respect to criminal record if you successfully completed a Pre-Trial Intervention program (PTI) for an offense and have not been convicted or pled guilty to another disqualifying offense.\n\n\nbe at least 18 years of age; and\nbe able to read and understand the English language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. I received a Juror Summons for a family member that has passed. What should I do?\n        \nIf you receive a Juror Summons or Juror Questionnaire addressed to a person who is deceased, please contact the summoning Jury Management Office. This will allow the Judiciary to make the record ineligible for future selection.\nBy law, the Judiciary annually receives records from the New Jersey Department of Taxation, Motor Vehicle Commission, and Division of Elections for the master jury list. Please make sure to notify those agencies to avoid a record mistakenly coming to the Judiciary in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How do I know if I need to report for jury duty?\n        \nTo determine if you are required to report for jury duty, visit the Juror Reporting Page\u00a0after 5:00 p.m. the evening before your summons date.\nJurors may also receive email or text messages regarding their service. This service is not available to jurors who opted out of receiving messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. What are the different types of juror service in New Jersey?\n        \nYou may be summoned for one of three types of jury service. You may be summoned to serve as a Petit Juror, a Grand Juror, or a State Grand Juror.\n\nPetit Jury service includes criminal and civil trials. Petit jurors who sit on a criminal trial decide guilt or innocence in a criminal matter. Petit jurors who sit on a civil trial decide liability or damages.\nGrand Jury determine whether there is enough evidence to move forward with criminal charges against a defendant.\nState Grand Jury and county grand jury operate similarly but the State Grand Jury has statewide jurisdiction and representation and meets in Trenton rather than one of the county seats.\n\nPlease also be aware that you may be summoned to serve as a federal petit juror or grand juror in U.S. District Court. Such service is independent of N.J. Superior Court jury service.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Is there a dress code for jurors reporting?\n        \nJurors reporting for service should wear clothing appropriate for an appearance in court. Shorts, t-shirts, uniforms or clothing containing statements or offensive symbols are not permitted. All hats must be removed when in a courtroom. Comfortable clothing is also advisable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. Where does the list of jurors come from?\n        \nThe Judiciary is required by statute to create a single list for juror selection that combines names of registered voters, licensed drivers, filers of N.J. personal income tax returns.\nCitizens can assist in this process by using their legal name when filing relevant forms and checking to ensure that all information, including address and identifiers, is accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Q. How much do I get paid for jury service?\n        \nPetit jurors are paid $5 dollars for each day of service. If a petit juror serves more than three days, the pay rate will increase to $40 per day beginning on the fourth day.\nGrand jurors are paid $5 dollars for each day of service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "child_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/general-jury-information", "https://www.njcourts.gov/rescheduling-requests", "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/jurors/quickreferenceguide-jury.pdf", "https://www.njcourts.gov/public/news-media/court-closings", "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12308_physician_cert.pdf", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq#493196", "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12140_jury_duty_childcare.pdf", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/contact", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/reporting", "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12255_jury_financial_hardship.pdf", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq", "https://www.njcourts.gov/excusal-requests", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/service", "https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors", "https://www.njcourts.gov/", "https://www.njcourts.gov/videoconference-instructions", "https://www.njcourts.gov/new-jersey-state-grand-jury"], "isFile": false, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12308_physician_cert.pdf": {"title": "12308_physician_cert.pdf", "text": "", "child_pages": [], "isFile": true, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq#493196"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/jurors/quickreferenceguide-jury.pdf": {"title": "quickreferenceguide-jury.pdf", "text": "", "child_pages": [], "isFile": true, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/jurors/faq#493196"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/jurors/testingzoomweb.pdf": {"title": "testingzoomweb.pdf", "text": "", "child_pages": [], "isFile": true, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/videoconference-instructions"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/jurors/testingzoomcomp.pdf": {"title": "testingzoomcomp.pdf", "text": "", "child_pages": [], "isFile": true, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/videoconference-instructions"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/jurors/testingzoomios.pdf": {"title": "testingzoomios.pdf", "text": "", "child_pages": [], "isFile": true, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/videoconference-instructions"]}, "https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/jurors/testingzoomandroid.pdf": {"title": "testingzoomandroid.pdf", "text": "", "child_pages": [], "isFile": true, "parent_pages": ["https://www.njcourts.gov/videoconference-instructions"]}}
