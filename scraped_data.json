Whether or not your employer pays you for jury duty depends on your employment situation, including employers' policies, union contracts, etc. The State of New Jersey will pay you the appropriate juror fee as set forth in the New Jersey statutes. The Jury Management Office is aware that many employers do not pay their employees during jury duty. If service as a juror will create a severe financial hardship, as set forth in N.J.S.A. 2B:20-10, you may request to be excused. But please be aware that nonpayment by your employer, by itself, is not a valid reason to be excused from service. Each situation will be reviewed individually. If you are employed full time by the State of New Jersey, you will receive your usual compensation while you serve as a juror. However, in accordance with N.J.S.A. 2B:20-16 you will not receive juror payment. This law applies to persons employed full time by any agency, independent authority, instrumentality of the State of any political subdivision of the State (such as counties or municipalities). Jurors affected by this policy should notify the Jury Management Office when they report for service. If a check is issued to you in error, you will be required to return it to the Jury Management Office. ",

		"text": " Q. Why is it important that I serve as a juror? Jurors are an essential part of our justice system. The right to trial by jury in the United States dates from Colonial times and is rooted in English history. It is guaranteed by the Sixth and Seventh Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America and Article One of New Jersey\u2019s State Constitution. People have a right to have matters determined by a jury of their peers. Participating in our judicial system is not only an honor, but is also one of our civic duties. Although juror service may be inconvenient, citizens must participate in the jury process in order for it to work. Cases that go to trial need to be resolved by citizens who hear the evidence, determine the facts and render a verdict. It is impossible to get a fair cross-section of the community to participate in the jury system if people do not report for jury service. If you ever found yourself or a loved one involved in a civil or criminal trial, it's likely that you would want a jury of fellow citizens who will be fair and impartial. ",

You may request to be excused from jury service you if fall into one of the categories below. You are 75 years of age or older. You will be required to provide your DOB the Jury Management Office. You have served as a juror in the same county within the last three years. You will be required to provide the date you served. You believe that you will suffer a severe financial hardship. In order to be excused for financial reasons, you must show that serving as a juror will cause a severe financial hardship that will compromise your ability to support yourself and/or your dependents. You will also be required to submit to the Jury Management Office a certification (sworn statement) listing the sources of your household income; whether you will be paid during jury service; and the impact of the length of service. Jurors who report for service may speak with the trial judge regarding any financial hardships based on the anticipated length of the trial. You have a medical inability to serve as a juror. If you suffer from a medical condition that is unlikely to change within a year, and this condition prevents you from serving on jury duty, you may request to be excused or rescheduled. You and your doctor will be required to complete the Physician certification in Support of Medical Excuse Request certification. The Judiciary will also accept a note from a doctor that states the juror has a medical condition and the duration that this condition prevents them from serving jury duty. The court may request additional, non-confidential information if necessary to determine a request for an excusal. You care for a minor child, or a sick, aged, or infirm dependent, and have no alternative care available without suffering severe financial hardship. When requesting to be excused for any of these circumstances, keep in mind that the Jury Management Office will grant you time to arrange for alternative care. Please be aware that the Judiciary will accommodate mothers who are breastfeeding and will provide a suitable private location for their use during the day. The Jury Management Office will also require supplemental documentation for excusal requests as indicated below: If you are requesting an excuse based upon a personal obligation to care for a sick, aged, or infirm dependent, you must submit a doctor\u2019s note from a licensed physician stating that you are the sole caregiver and your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of that person. If you are requesting an excuse based upon a personal obligation to care for a minor child or children, you must submit to the Jury Management Office the certification which states you are personally obligated to care for the minor child(ren). By completing this certification, you acknowledge that the court may require further information and/or financial documentation in support of the request. You provide highly specialized technical healthcare services for which a replacement cannot reasonably be obtained. The Jury Management Office will require proof of licensing as a healthcare provider and a letter from your employer verifying that no coverage can be reasonably obtained. You are a healthcare worker directly involved in the care of a person with a mental or physical disability, and your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of that person. You will be required to provide a letter from your employer verifying that your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of the person. You are full-time teacher of a grammar/high school during the school year for which a replacement cannot be reasonably obtained. You will be required to submit a letter from your school superintendent confirming you are full time instructional staff and indicating either an excuse is necessary due to the volume of teachers called at the time or you are a special education teacher and it is essential for you to be in attendance. Other teachers who cannot find a replacement, may reschedule their service. You are an active member of a volunteer fire department, fire patrol, first aid or rescue squad. The Jury Management Office will require a letter on letterhead from your fire captain/EMT squad captain; or identification showing active volunteer status (must not be expired). You are on active duty as a member of the United States military. In order to be excused from jury service, you must be on active duty on the summons date and the military service must be in the United States military, which includes members of the National Guard who are assigned to active duty.
