        "If you receive a Juror Summons or Juror Questionnaire addressed to a person who is deceased, please contact the summoning Jury Management Office. This will allow the Judiciary to make the record ineligible for future selection. In addition, please make sure to also notify New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission and New Jersey Division of Elections as juror lists are generated from these sources.
