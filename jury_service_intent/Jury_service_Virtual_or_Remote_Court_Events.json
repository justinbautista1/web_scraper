    "Generally, for remote proceedings, you should have received an email with general correspondence and a link for the Zoom proceeding. The local court should be able to assist, but if you are unable to contact them directly you may wish to review the Courtâ€™s website to see if there is another number and/or contact for the issue you are having.  Assistance and contact information related to virtual/remote events can be found on the courts website <a href=\"https://www.njcourts.gov/attorneys/remote-instructions\">Visit Instructions for Participants in Remote Court Events</a>"
