IMPORTANT MESSAGE REGARDING POTENTIAL JUROR SCAMS:
The New Jersey Judiciary does not and has never asked for jurors banking information or social security numbers over the phone, by email, or in person. Court officials will never ask for payment to avoid arrest for failure to report for jury duty. Anyone who has concerns about being approached inappropriately concerning jury duty should contact the county jury manager as well as local law enforcement.
Dear Juror: Please read the entire message carefully.
Jury Management office hours are Monday - Friday 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.

The email will also include information about the time to report, the free parking garage location, the room in the courthouse to report, lunch time information, the ability to bring laptops or reading materials, and much more. Please read the email thoroughly. If you did not receive reporting instructions check your spam or junk folder in the event it was diverted there. It is also important to note, that the Bergen County Courthouse does not conduct virtual jury selection for petit jurors.

Message from Assignment Judge Carol V.  Novey Catuogno



On behalf of the Bergen County Superior Court, I would like to welcome you. Everyone connected with the court system recognizes that when we ask our citizens to report for jury service it represents a personal inconvenience to each and every one of you. However, jury service is an important duty of citizenship and fundamental to our entire system of justice. The Courts cannot function without members of the public offering their time to serve as jurors. We value your service as a juror and know that you will find your experience with the courts to be rewarding. Thank you for serving.








Health and Safety
If you feel sick, do not report to the courthouse. Instead, contact your local jury management office to reschedule your service.
Voluntary Demographic Information
The juror questionnaire includes three voluntary demographic questions. This information helps the Judiciary understand the diversity and representativeness of jury pools. Your responses to these questions are optional and will not affect your selection.
